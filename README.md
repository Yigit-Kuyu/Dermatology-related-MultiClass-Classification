## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into one of five dermatology-related categories:

- Acne
- Atopic Dermatitis
- Bullous Diseases
- Cancer
- Other

After training, you will obtain:

- **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **[Confusion Matrix](confusion_matrix.png)**: A heatmap visualization of true vs. predicted labels.
- **ROC-AUC Scores**:
  -  Macro-Average One-vs-One ROC AUC: Measures overall model performance.
   - Per-Class ROC AUC: Assesses how well the model distinguishes each class.
